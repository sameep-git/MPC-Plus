Need:

data:
--------------
Vertical symmetry: -1.786%
Horizontal symmetry: 3.521%

Vertical flatness: 5.625%
Horizontal flatness: 5.439%
--> Has threshold values (tbd on them)

Need Graph - Symettry Profile


MPC Output:
Always "Relative to the baseline"
Need DOC - Dose output Correction
If you do baseline, you must tell it absolute dose at that point in time (At that point relative will be 0, duh)
Need Settings: Absolute output input, & History Of
1 month leway 


Baseline:
Done at the machine level
No fucntionality needed
Down steream proces 
Get isBaseline from XML


Monday:
Need graphs from Field Analysis
   --> (Points, Matrix, Picture?)
   USE A picture
Database set up --> Uploader

Change:: Symm and Flat be apart of beam models
        Images NEED TO BE PNG

Change uploader so checks if isbaseline

Need DOC - Dose output Correction

Chance naming convention of images
-->beamtype/machineID/dateTime
Change to this:
machine_id/date/beam_type/time/ beamImage
machine_id/date/beam_type/time/ F&SGraph
machine_id/date/GEO/time/ All

Thursday - F & S to beam model:
- Images must be PNG 
-Commit
-Getters and Setters in beam model
-Beam processor/Data processor call image processor
-Commit
-Uploader to adopt F & S  


Friday Meeting Notes:

Change all prints to loggers
Verify connection works
Look at Geo Checkks in Uploader.py
Line 150-187 Dataprocessor, need more error handling
Fix relative imports
Recognize 2.5x

Get mini graphs to DB
Uploader to adopt F & S
Upload Images
Recognize 2.5x adn 10xFFF beam (need 10xFFF data)
