Need:

data:
--------------
Vertical symmetry: -1.786%
Horizontal symmetry: 3.521%

Vertical flatness: 5.625%
Horizontal flatness: 5.439%
--> Has threshold values (tbd on them)

Need Graph - Symettry Profile


MPC Output:
Always "Relative to the baseline"
Need DOC - Dose output Correction
If you do baseline, you must tell it absolute dose at that point in time (At that point relative will be 0, duh)
Need Settings: Absolute output input, & History Of
1 month leway 


Baseline:
Done at the machine level
No fucntionality needed
Down steream proces 
Get isBaseline from XML


Monday:
Need graphs from Field Analysis
   --> (Points, Matrix, Picture?)
   USE A picture
Database set up --> Uploader
Change:: Symm and Flat be apart of beam models

Change uploader so checks if isbaseline

Need DOC - Dose output Correction
Chance naming convention of images
-->beamtype/machineID/dateTime
Change to this:
machine_id/date/beam_type/time/ beamImage
machine_id/date/beam_type/time/ F&SGraph
machine_id/date/GEO/time/ All
